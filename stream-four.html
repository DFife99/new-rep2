            <span>What should my commit message say?</span><br>
            <br> Ideally, your message should explain what the commit contains. The commit message can be as long as you like, and should be detailed. Here are some examples of bad commit messages: Fixed error Added page Updated README.md
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>Why are these bad? Because they don't give any meaningful information about what the commit contains. Here are the improved versions of the above messages:</span><br>
            <br> Fixed the bug that caused the main image to overflow the screen Added the boilerplate code to about.html for the About Me page Added testing and deployment information to the README.md file <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>Why does it matter for a personal project?</span><br>
            <br> The main reason it matters is so that you (and anyone else who is interested in your project) can see the history and roll things back if required. We want you to learn good software development habits throughout the programme, and writing
            clear, meaningful commit messages is an important part of being a good citizen in the development community. Additionally, you will be assessed on the quality of your commit messages when you submit your end-of-module projects, so it makes
            sense to take some time to write descriptive commit messages.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>>Is there a recommnded format for commit messages?</span><br>
            <br> If your message says something like: Fixed width of heroImage.jpg in index.html to look ok on all screen sizes, then that's a good message. You could adopt the convention that some developers use of prefixing their commit messages with
            feat for feature, fix for a bugfix, style for changes to your CSS, docs for changes related to documentation, refactor for refactored code or maint for general maintenance. So, the above example would look like this: fix: width of heroImage.jpg
            in index.html to look good on all screen sizes. If you were updating your README file, you could have a commit message like this: docs: Added testing and deployment sections to README.md. If you do choose to use a format like this, then be
            consistent throughout your project and use it for every commit.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span> how often should I commit?</span><br>
            <br> That is entirely up to you. A good rule of thumb is to commit after every major change or addition of a new page or feature. Smaller changes, such as grammar, spelling and minor content changes don't necessarily need their own commit
            each time, but group about four or five of them into one commit. Keep in mind these things as you progress through the programme, and make sure you are always writing descriptive and meaningful commit messages. We suggest that you refer back
            to this section when you start your milestone project.
